# Quick Email Notification Setup Guide

## Why You Didn't Receive Emails

The email notification system wasn't working because:

1. **Edge Function Not Deployed**: The Supabase Edge Function wasn't deployed
2. **Email Service Not Configured**: No email provider was set up
3. **Environment Variables Missing**: Email settings weren't configured

## Quick Fix - Simulation Mode

I've created a **simulation mode** that you can test immediately:

### 1. Test the Email System

1. Go to your Dashboard
2. Look for the "Email Notification Status" card
3. Click "Test Email Notification"
4. Check your browser console (F12) to see the email content

### 2. Enable Email Notifications

To enable real email notifications, create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Enable email notifications
VITE_EMAIL_ENABLED=true

# App URL
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test Todo Creation

1. Go to the Todo List page
2. Create a new todo and assign it to yourself
3. Check the browser console for email notification logs

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Email System**: Working in simulation mode  
‚úÖ **Todo Integration**: Automatically triggers email notifications  
‚úÖ **Test Components**: Available on Dashboard  
‚ùå **Real Email Sending**: Not configured yet  

## What You'll See

When you test the email system, you'll see logs like this in the browser console:

```
üìß EMAIL NOTIFICATION SIMULATION:
To: your-email@example.com
Subject: New Task Assigned: Test Task
HTML Content Length: 1234
Text Content Length: 567
‚úÖ Email notification simulated successfully
```

## Next Steps for Real Emails

To send actual emails, you'll need to:

1. **Choose an Email Provider**:
   - Resend (recommended, free tier available)
   - SendGrid
   - Mailgun
   - Custom SMTP

2. **Get API Key**:
   - Sign up for your chosen provider
   - Get an API key

3. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   VITE_EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
   VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Deploy Edge Function** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI first
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   
   # Deploy the function
   supabase functions deploy send-todo-notification
   ```

## Testing Right Now

1. **Open your browser console** (F12)
2. **Go to Dashboard** and click "Test Email Notification"
3. **Create a todo** and assign it to yourself
4. **Check console logs** to see email content

The system is working - it's just in simulation mode until you configure a real email provider!
